# LF-MSLR: Multimodal Fusion for Sign Language Recognition

## üìå Overview
**LF-MSLR (Late Fusion-Based Multi-modal Sign Language Recognition)** integrates multiple modalities‚Äî**RGB video frames, optical flow, and skeleton data**‚Äîto improve sign language recognition accuracy. Our model uses keyframe identification and a **Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) network** for classification, achieving state-of-the-art results.

## üöÄ Key Features
- **Multimodal Fusion**: Combines RGB, Optical Flow, and Skeleton Data.
- **Keyframe Extraction**: Focuses on crucial frames to reduce redundancy.
- **Late Fusion Strategy**: Integrates features from different modalities effectively.
- **High Accuracy**: Achieved **95%+ on Include-50** and **92%+ on SMILE-DSGS** datasets.

## üìÇ Dataset Download (SMILE-DSGS)
Due to large file size, download **SMILE-DSGS** manually:
```bash
pip install gdown
gdown "https://github.com/neccam/slt/"
```
## üìÇ Dataset Download (INCLUDE-50)
Due to large file size, download **Include-50** manually:
```bash
pip install gdown
gdown "https://zenodo.org/records/4010759"
```


## üõ† Installation
1. **Clone this repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/renjithscse/LF_MSLR.git
   cd LF-MSLR
   ```
   
---

### **3. `requirements.txt`**
```txt
opencv-python
numpy
tensorflow
keras
mediapipe
torch
torchvision
torch-geometric

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3 Preprocessing

Use `preprocessing.py` to extract frames, compute optical flow, and extract skeleton data from videos.

4 Data Loading

`dataloader.py` defines the `SignLanguageDataset` class, which loads frames, skeletons, and labels for training.

   ```
5. **Run the model**:
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```
